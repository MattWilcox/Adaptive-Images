    <h1>Adaptive-Images Instructions</h1>
    <h2>Basic instructions</h2>
    <p>Copy <code>adaptive-images.php</code> and <code>.htaccess</code> into the root directory of your site. If you already have a htaccess file DO NOT OVERWRITE IT, skip down to the advanced instructions.</p>
    <p>Create a directory called <code>ai-cache</code> in the root of your site and give it write permissions (CHMOD 777).</p>
    <p>Copy the following Javascript into the &lt;head&gt; of your site. It MUST go in the head because it needs to work before the page has finished loading, and before any images have been requested.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;var device_width=screen.width;var device_height=screen.height;if(device_width>device_height){ai_width=device_width;}else{ai_width=device_height;}
document.cookie='resolution='+ai_width+'; expires=; path=/';&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>That's it, you're done.</p>
    
    <h2>Advanced Instructions</h2>
    <p>OK, you're here because you've already got a .htaccess file. I strongly advise you to duplicate that file so you can revert to it if things go pear-shaped.</p>
    <p>Open your existing .htaccess file and edit the contents. You'll need to look and see if there is a section that begins with the following:</p>
    <p><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;</code></p>
    <p>If there is, then you need to add the following lines into that block:</p>
    
<pre><code># Adaptive-Images -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Add any directories you wish to omit from the Responsive-Images process on a new line, as follows:
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !some-directory
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !another-directory

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !assets

# Send any GIF, JPG, or PNG request that IS NOT stored inside one of the above directories
# to image-routing.php so we can select appropriately sized versions
RewriteRule \.(jpg|jpeg|gif|png) image-routing.php

# END Adaptive-Images -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</code></pre>

<p>If you don't have a code block then simply copy and paste the following into your file instead:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
  Options +FollowSymlinks
  RewriteEngine On

  # Adaptive-Images -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Add any directories you wish to omit from the Responsive-Images process on a new line, as follows:
  # RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !some-directory
  # RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !another-directory

  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !assets

  # Send any GIF, JPG, or PNG request that IS NOT stored inside one of the above directories
  # to image-routing.php so we can select appropriately sized versions
  RewriteRule \.(jpg|jpeg|gif|png) image-routing.php

  # END Adaptive-Images -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;/IfModule&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Additional settings and configuration</h2>
    <h3>.htaccess</h3>
    <p>Instructions are in the file as comments (any line that starts with a # is a comment, and doesn't actually do anything)</p>
    <p>Follow the instructions inside that code to specify any directories you don't want to use Adaptive-Images on.</p>
    
    <h3>PHP</h3>
    <p>You can now open the php file and have a play with the settings that are in the CONFIG area. By default it looks like this:</p>
      
<pre><code>/* CONFIG ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

$resolutions   = array(1382,992,768,480,320); // the resolution break-points to use (screen widths, in pixels)
$cache_path    = "ai-cache"; // where to store the generated re-sized images. This folder must be writable.
$jpg_quality   = 80; // the quality of any generated JPGs on a scale of 0 to 100
$sharpen       = TRUE; // Shrinking images can blur details, perform a sharpen on re-scaled images?
$watch_cache   = TRUE; // check that the responsive image isn't stale (ensures updated source images are re-cached)
$browser_cache = 60*60*24*7; // How long the BROWSER cache should last (seconds, minutes, hours, days. 7days by default)

/* END CONFIG ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------ Don't edit anything after this line unless you know what you're doing -------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */</code></pre>
  <p><code>$resolutions</code> are the screen widths we'll work with. In the default it will store a re-sized image for large screens, normal screens, tablets, phones, and tiny phones.</p>
  <p>In general, if you're using a responsive design in CSS, these breakpoints will be exactly the same as the ones you use in your media queries.</p>
  <p><code>$cache_path</code> If you don't like the cached images being written to that folder, you can put it somewhere else. Just put the path to the folder here and make sure you create it on the server.</p>
  <p><code>$sharpen</code> Will perform a subtle sharpening on the rescaled images. Usually this is fine, but you may want to turn it off if your server is very very busy.</p>
  <p><code>$watch_cache</code> If your server gets very busy it may help performance to turn this to FALSE. It will mean however that you will have to manually clear out the cache directory if you change a resource file</p>
  
  <h3>JavaScript</h3>
  <p>If you like, here's the long-hand version, so you can understand what the JS is doing. Don't use this one in your real site, though the code is doing the same thing:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
/* we want to get the image for the largest window size the device can support, not just the current window size */
var device_width  = screen.width; // get screen width
var device_height = screen.height; // get the screen height

/* if this is a device that can rotate, we need the longest edge, not just the current width */
if (device_width > device_height) {
  ri_width = device_width;
} else {
  ri_width = device_height;
}

/* set the client width in a cookie for the server to read */
document.cookie = 'resolution='+ri_width+'; expires=; path=/'; // set or update the cookie
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
  </body>
