 * * *Breakpoints and sizes* * Now you can define, what size an image has to have on specific configurable * design breakpoints equal to your CSS media queries. Your can give them * custom names (the "size term") and set the their widths in pixel or percentage. * If you use for instance 100% as a default case, the image will be 100% of the * size of the resolution, that is equal or closest higher than the present users * device maximum width – but maximum width of the largest configured resolution * breakpoint but also not larger than the original full-res image size. *  *  * *Cropping (cutting to fit)* * You can define an aspect ratio for a term. All depending images will be cropped * to that ratio after resizing is done. *  *  * *Sharpen* * You can define if you want to sharpen the resized images and even the amount of * sharpness applied. 0 is no sharpening at all, up to 30 is subtile, more than 30 is * really impacting, max is 500 (imagine that!). Usually doing this is fine, * but you may want to turn it off if your server is very very busy. *  * *JPEG quality* * You can define the JPEG quality for a size term when device pixel ratio is at 1. * If above 1 (= "retina"), you can set a different JPEG compression level – very useful * for applying "Netvlies Retina Revolution Trick" * (http://blog.netvlies.nl/design-interactie/retina-revolution/) if you want to use it. * JPEG quality 100: of course is best; down to 70: is pleasant; * below 40: really compressed (and small in size). *  *  * *Prevent cache* * For developing, you might want to disable caching, to see changes of the * setup and the images on  * every page reload. For this, setup the following * in the Main Settings section: *  * $config['browser_cache'] = 0; * $config['prevent_cache'] = TRUE; *  * But remember to turn caching on again, when the site is going live! *  *  * *Debug mode* * This inserts some information into the generated images like: image dimensions, * the aspect ratio, the device-width and pixel density. *  * Turn this off when site goes live! *  *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * */	// MAIN SETTINGS	// where to store the generated image files; specify from your DOCUMENT_ROOT!	// Make sure the folders have at least 755 permission!	// If you don't like the cached images being written to that folder, you can put it somewhere else.	// Just put the path to the folder here and make sure you create it on the server	// if for some reason that couldn't be done automatically by adaptive-images.php.	$config['cache_path']           = 'adaptive-images/ai-cache';		// checks if the adapted image in cache aren’t outdated; ensures updated source images are cached again.	// In case your server gets very busy, it may help performance to turn this to FALSE.	// It will mean however, that you will have to manually clear out the cache directory if you change a resource file		$config['watch_cache']          = TRUE;			// default: true		// other caching settings	$config['browser_cache']        = 60 * 60 * 24;	// period of time in seconds the images will stay in cache of browsers		$config['browser_cache']		  = 0;			// enable this line line during developement!	$config['prevent_cache']        = TRUE; 		// true: images will resized on every image request; default: false	// while developing: inserts information like image dimensions, ratio and the device-width into the image	$config['debug_mode']           = TRUE;			// default: false		 	// ORIGINAL BEHAVIOR – Matts original device resolution depending solution	// true: to have this original automatic resizer enabled; this is the default	// false: to only use the size terms in a query string and serve the original full res pic at a "native request"	$config['enable_resolutions']   = TRUE;      	// Here are our breakpoints for the default behavior; screen widths in pixels	$config['resolutions']          = array(0, 320, 480, 640, 1080, 1440, 2048, 2880);	// Now new in AIue: kind of 'one size fits all' values, corresponding to the resolutions above	// These image widths are served, when a specific resolution is present	$config['scalings']             = array(0, 320, 480, 640,  960, 1440, 1920, 2880); 	// This is part of Johanns extended version introducing the "size terms"	// Configure the internal breakpoint names here	// These values should be equal to the resolutions above, to not confuse things more than necessary	// NOTE: the corresponting ['scalings'] from above do apply anyway!	// That’s why the array sizes MUST be equal in any case!	$config['breakpoints'] = array(	                                 'default' =>    0,	                                 'micro'   =>  320,	                                 'mini'    =>  480,	                                 'small'   =>  640,	                                 'medium'  => 1080,	                                 'normal'  => 1440,	                                 'large'   => 2048,	                                 'huge'    => 2880	                              );								// Check if the array sizes are equal, because this is very important!	// If you receive the error message, align the sizes of the three arrays above!	$line = __LINE__; 	$line = $line - 1;	$error_str = "Error in Adaptive Images: all array sizes MUST be equal to work correctly!<br>			    Check " . __FILE__ .
